# Serilog_Setup
Some options for configuring Serilog and it's optional packages.

This is using the the Timer option as well.

Configured to override the default logging provider.

As an aside there is also a launchSettings option(http-Production) which will load the appsetting.Production.json and not the appsettings.Development.json.
